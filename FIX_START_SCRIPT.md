# ✅ Fixed: start.ps1 "No module named pygame" Error

## What Was Wrong

When you ran `.\start.ps1`, it was trying to activate the venv using `Activate.ps1`, but PowerShell script execution doesn't properly inherit the activated environment within the same script. So when it ran `python main.py`, it was still using the system Python (3.14) instead of the venv Python (3.13 with pygame).

## The Fix

Updated `start.ps1` to use the venv's Python executable directly:

**Before:**
```powershell
& ".\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"  # Doesn't persist in script
python main.py                     # Uses system Python ❌
```

**After:**
```powershell
$venvPython = ".\.venv\Scripts\python.exe"
& $venvPython main.py              # Uses venv Python ✅
```

## How to Use Now

### Quick Start (Easiest)
```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

This now works correctly! It will:
1. Check if `.venv` exists
2. Check if pygame is installed (and install if needed)
3. Run the game using the venv's Python directly

### Alternative Methods

**Method 1: Direct venv Python**
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

**Method 2: Manual activation (for development)**
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main.py
deactivate  # when done
```

**Method 3: VS Code (Press F5)**
- VS Code automatically uses `.venv` when you run/debug

## Why This Happens

PowerShell's `Activate.ps1` modifies the current shell's environment variables, but when called from within a script using `&` (call operator), those changes don't persist for subsequent commands in the same script. The solution is to call the venv's Python executable directly.

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - `.\start.ps1` now works correctly without "No module named pygame" error!

**Note:** You may see a harmless Windows warning "Unable to initialize device PRN" - this is just a printer device warning and doesn't affect the game.

# ✅ Virtual Environment Setup Complete!

## What Was Done

1. ✅ Created Python 3.13 virtual environment (`.venv/`)
2. ✅ Installed pygame 2.6.1 (compatible with Python 3.13)
3. ✅ Generated `requirements.txt` for easy reinstallation
4. ✅ Created `.gitignore` to exclude venv from version control
5. ✅ Created `SETUP.md` with full installation instructions
6. ✅ Created `start.ps1` quick-start helper script
7. ✅ Verified game runs successfully

## Quick Start (Daily Use)

### Option 1: Quick Start Script (Recommended)
```powershell
.\start.ps1
```
This automatically uses the venv's Python and checks dependencies.

### Option 2: Use venv Python directly
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

### Option 3: Manual Activation (for development)
```powershell
# Activate venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run game
python main.py

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

## Your Virtual Environment

**Location:** `.venv/` (using Python 3.13.7)

**Installed Packages:**
- pygame==2.6.1

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No more package conflicts
- ✅ Clean, isolated environment
- ✅ No import warnings/errors
- ✅ Easy to replicate on other machines
- ✅ Compatible with pygame (Python 3.14 had issues)

## Why Python 3.13?

Your system had Python 3.14 (pre-release), but pygame 2.6.1 doesn't have pre-built wheels for 3.14 yet. Python 3.13 is the latest stable version with full pygame support.

## Files Created

- `.venv/` - Virtual environment folder (excluded from git)
- `requirements.txt` - Package dependencies
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `start.ps1` - Quick start script

## Troubleshooting

### "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Reinstall packages
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start fresh
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .venv
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Team Sharing

When sharing with teammates, they only need to:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run: `py -3.13 -m venv .venv`
3. Run: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
4. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run: `python main.py`

Or simply: `.\start.ps1`
